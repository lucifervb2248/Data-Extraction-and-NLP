Data Extraction and NLP:
First I just did web scraping all the articles using beautifulsoup and saved them each in a text file and save it in a folder
Then i just combined all the stopwords text file into one and then removed the punctuation marks and saved it as a text file
And then i just removed all the stopwords from each text file and stored that in a new folder
And then i just started calculating all the variables to be found by iterating through each text file
For positive score,negative score i just iterated every word in the text file given for positive and negative words and calculated it
And using that polarity score and subjectivity score is calculated
For calculating analysis of readability i went through every text file and calculated it
And for word count to remove the punctuation i used string library
And for syllable count and pronoun count is done using a dictionary called cmudict which is similar to stopwords in nltk library
And after calculating everything for each text file it is stored in a csv file with index as filename and done

This the instructions on how to run the  file:
To run the file open jupyter notebook and run every cell

Dependencies:
